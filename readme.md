## GPT2 inference implemenation with numpy

Implementation of [GPT-2](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2) using numpy and scipy.

I have tried to make the code as simple as possible, so that it can be easily understood for educational purpose.
GPT inference is not very complex. I thought I can implement inference code without using any deep learning framework. I hope this code will help you understand how GPT works.

### Usage
```bash
bash download-model.sh 117M # download model. this script is brought from ggml.
python3 run.py # run inference
```

or see `example.ipynb` for usage.
